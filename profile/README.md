Build and ship durable functions and workflows **in your current codebase** without any additional infrastructure. Using Inngest, your entire team can ship reliable products.

1. ‚å®Ô∏è Write functions using the [**Inngest SDK**](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) right in your existing codebase
2. üíª Run the [open source **Inngest Dev Server**](https://github.com/inngest/inngest) on your machine for a complete local development experience, with production parity (`npx inngest-cli@latest dev`)
3. üöÄ Ship your app to your existing infra and the **Inngest platform** will invoke your code securely via HTTPS as new jobs are created enabling you to run your code _anywhere_: serverless, servers or edge. No need to set up queues or workers - Inngest handles that for you.
